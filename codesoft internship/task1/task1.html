                <span class="tooltiptext3">"Leftover Love" is a unique food-providing application that serves as a bridge between restaurants and NGOs. The app facilitates the donation of excess food from restaurants to NGOs, who then distribute this food to those in need. Restaurants can easily list their surplus food on the platform, specifying details such as quantity and pickup times. NGOs, in turn, can browse available donations and schedule pickups directly through the app. This innovative approach not only reduces food waste but also ensures that surplus food reaches deserving individuals who can benefit from it the most.</span>
